# Form Validation Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates a simple **form validation** system using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The form includes input fields for **Name**, **Email**, and **Password**, and provides real-time validation to ensure the fields are correctly filled before submission. Error messages are shown to guide users in correcting their inputs.

## Features

- **Name Validation**: Ensures the name field is not empty.
- **Email Validation**: Checks for a valid email format using regular expressions.
- **Password Validation**: Ensures the password is at least 6 characters long.
- **Error Handling**: Displays custom error messages below the relevant input fields.
- **Responsive Design**: The form layout is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Prevent Form Submission**: The form will not submit unless all validation checks pass.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Markup for creating the structure of the form.
- **CSS**: Styling the form layout and appearance, including error messages.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the validation logic to check input values and show feedback.

## Files Included

- `index.html`: Contains the form structure and links to CSS and JavaScript files.
- `styles.css`: Handles the styling for the form, including input fields, buttons, and error messages.
- `script.js`: Contains JavaScript code for validating the form inputs and displaying error messages.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this project to your local machine or download it as a ZIP file.
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rameshkumar7279/form-validation-project.git

2. **Open the HTML file**: Navigate to the project folder and open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

   - Displays "Invalid email format" if the email is incorrect.
   
3. **Password Field**:
   - Must contain at least 6 characters.
   - Displays "Password must be at least 6 characters" if the requirement is not met.
